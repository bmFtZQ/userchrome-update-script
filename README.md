# userchrome-update-script
Update script for Edge-Frfox, but can be reused for any other Firefox userChrome.css theme.

1. download version for your operating system
2. add your profile ID (`xxxxxxxx.default-release` being the placeholder in the scripts)
3. give the script executable permissions: `chmod +x script.sh` (Linux and macOS)

If you want to use this script for other themes, then change the`UPDATEURL` variable using this template: `https://github.com/ORGANIZATION/REPOSITORY/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz`
